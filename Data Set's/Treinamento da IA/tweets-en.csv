negative, then told to offload because the captain was over hours? this has been a terrible experience.
negative," why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours late flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"

negative," - i bet you don't, but i'm the paying customer here. i know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
negative," i can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
negative, oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  flight 1137 has been awful

negative, the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. you are ruining people's memories! you should be ashamed!
negative," 1st a late flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. you call this customer service??"
negative," due to your expensive change fees either. out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. stranded!! no help!"
negative," we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
